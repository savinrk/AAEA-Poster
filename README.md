Highly customized poster template for conference presentations (or whatever you want), with a University of Georgia flavor. 

Compile [main.tex](https://github.com/savinrk/AAEA-Poster/blob/main/main.tex) using LuaLaTeX in Overleaf/TexStudio/your favorite program to get the [AAEA-Poster.pdf](https://github.com/savinrk/AAEA-Poster/blob/main/AAEA-poster.pdf) file. 
The Gemini theme has been forked from [anishathalye](https://github.com/anishathalye/gemini). Make sure to include the two relevant .sty files (uchicago and gemini), if you don't have them. 

Questions and modifications are welcome!

ERRATA: Don't make the same mistake I did and forget to acknowledge your advisor's doctorate :see_no_evil:. With apologies to Dr. Gopi.
